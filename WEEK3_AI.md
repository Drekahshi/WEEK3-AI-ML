Ethical Considerations: Bias in MNIST and Amazon Reviews Models
1. Potential Biases
MNIST (Handwritten Digits)
Demographic Bias: MNIST digits were collected from census employees and high school students, mostly from the US, which may not represent handwriting styles globally.
Digit Shape Bias: Digits may be written differently in other cultures or age groups, affecting model accuracy for international users.
Mitigation: Use datasets like EMNIST (includes more writers, letters) or diverse digit datasets.
Amazon Reviews (NLP)
Language & Expression Bias: Reviews may reflect the writing style, sentiment expression, or language of certain demographics more than others.
Brand/Product Mention Bias: Models may perform better on well-known brands or products with more data.
Sentiment Lexicon Bias: Rule-based sentiment may misclassify sarcasm, cultural expressions, or minority dialects.
Mitigation: Expand sentiment word lists, use diverse training data, and validate on different demographic slices.
2. Mitigating Bias with Tools
TensorFlow Fairness Indicators
What it does: Measures model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) across different user groups (e.g., age, gender, region).
How it helps:
Identifies disparities in model outcomes (e.g., certain groups have lower accuracy).
Guides model adjustments (e.g., rebalancing data, adjusting thresholds) to reduce unfair outcomes.
spaCy’s Rule-Based Systems
What it does: Customizes entity recognition and sentiment analysis using pattern rules.
How it helps:
Allows explicit handling of edge cases and minority group expressions missed by statistical models.
Can be adjusted to recognize diverse names, products, sentiment phrases, or dialects, reducing bias in NER/Sentiment tasks.
3. Example Actions
For MNIST: Use Fairness Indicators to compare digit classification accuracy for different age groups or writing styles (if metadata available).
For Amazon Reviews: Use spaCy rules to add sentiment expressions from underrepresented groups, and utilize Fairness Indicators to assess sentiment classification by region or reviewer background.
Summary:
Bias can be introduced via unbalanced datasets or simplistic rules. TensorFlow Fairness Indicators can quantify these issues, while spaCy’s rule-based systems enable targeted fixes. Both are essential for building fair, robust AI models.
